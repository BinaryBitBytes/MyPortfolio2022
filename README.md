# Goals for this portfolio
---

My primary goal is to host and showcase my projects sourced from my portfolio page. I want to grow this project by creating several pages and projects as well as great content. I hope to be able to make a simple game, embed a few videos, and create a chat tool for users to share information on my about me site.
